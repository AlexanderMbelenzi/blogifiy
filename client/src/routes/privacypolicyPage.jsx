          Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland). Such use includes the 'Universal Analytics' mode of
          operation. This makes it possible, if a user is logged into a Google service, to assign data, sessions and
          interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus to analyse the user's activities
          across such devices.

          website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, the corresponding IP
          addresses are anonymised beforehand using IP anonymisation. The anonymised IP address transmitted by your
          browser under Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. Google will use this information on
          our behalf for the purposes of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and
          providing other services relating to website activity and internet use.
        </p>
              <p>          If you wish to prevent the collection of data regarding your activity on our website by Google Analytics, you
